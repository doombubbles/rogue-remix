## Many Overhauls for BTD6 v48

### Artifact Limit

NK has now made a 10 Artifact Limit a CHIMPS Curse option, so this mod's own artifact limit is being removed.
The Artifact Expansion boosts are now percentage based, so +10% and +20% for +5 or +10 artifact limit outside this
CHIMPS Curse but the same +1 and +2 when it's active.

The functionality for getting tokens when you discard an artifact from your inventory is remaining with a new setting
name "Selling Replaces Discarding" (default on).

### Boosts Changes

NK has also added a CHIMPS curse option for turning off Boosts mid-game, as well as a nice QoL feature to have them
queued anyway. So, the "Boosts Remix" setting is just becoming the "Boosts In Shop" (still default on) setting which
controls the Boosts appearing in merchant shops.

This is something that may be revisited in a future update, given that it's now a bit confusing since they also added their
own permanent artifact versions of the Boosts.

### Vanilla Artifact Changes

Based on NK's balance updates, the following vanilla artifacts are no longer changed by this mod:

- BB Gatling Gun
- Critical Success
- Dazing Frostburn
- Heightened Perception
- Slow and Steady
- Spirit of Adventure
- The Unspoken Heroes

### Modded Artifact Changes

Two modded artifacts have been removed as they were essentially added by NK: Radar Operator (General's Disposition) and
Pirate Cove (Perceptive Crow).

Other Changes:
- Blade Lord and Precision Munitions both now start at Rare tier, effects unchanged
- Target Acquired fixed for Mortar Monkeys

### Hero Borders

Silver Border is now awarded for Stage 2, and Gold/Black Border for Stage 4
