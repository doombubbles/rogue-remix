- Because of an issue with the public profile, Rogue Remix extra completion data is migrating from being stored within your profile to just being stored locally
  - This will happen automatically the first time you open the game with the new mod version
  - To transfer data across devices, copy over the `BloonsTD6/Btd6ModHelper/Mod Settings/RogueRemix.json` file
