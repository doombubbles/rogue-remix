- Fixed for BTD6 v49
- Added a new setting Damage Boosts Affect Modifiers (default On)
    - By default, damage bonuses from boosts and artifacts don't affect additive modifiers like what Moab Maulers have.
      This setting makes them be affected.
- Added a new setting Always Stock Xp And MM (default On)
  - Makes merchants also stock the Rogue XP and Monkey Money tokens on stage 1 and after stage 4
- In the Merchant window, clicking on the stack count icon of a Token will automatically add as many as it takes to balance the trade / all of them depending on the context
- Added new categories at the bottom of Mod Settings where you can individually toggle Rogue Remix new artifacts and artifact changes
- Added new Artifacts
  - Tons of Damage - "Most artifacts that boost tower attack speed now instead boost tower damage. All towers do 10%/15%/25% more damage"
  - Camo Be Gone - "Projectiles that De-Camo Bloons have 2x pierce, and the towers that fire them have 10%/15%/25% more attack speed"
